# Hyperbolic Illusion

Hyperbolic Illusion, adapted from an open-source project [Curvascope](https://github.com/zenzicubic/Curvascope), is a tool for exploring visual illusions in various models of the hyperbolic plane. Hyperbolic Illusion is built using React, with ThreeJS/WebGL for rendering and realtime, and Ant Design for the UI. It produces hyperbolic tiling images by means of iterated circle inversions and Euclidean reflections based on triangle groups.
